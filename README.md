Also run a YouTube channel, i am the founder of the "Siber Güvenlik Akademisi" platform.

The information about me is reflected in the codes I have published on my GitHub profile and have confidence in the code and projects I create.

I have been in the industry for many years, as evidenced by the dates of my earliest GitHub repositories. I have achieved notable success in the field of cybersecurity, being recognized and rewarded by both the ministry and leading companies in the sector for my achievements in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Understanding how to build things has been facilitated by my expertise in breaking them down.
